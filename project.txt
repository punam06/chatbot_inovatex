INNOVATEX Hackathon Project Brief – Part 1  
(Pre-Hack Requirements) 
 
SDG 2 & SDG 12: AI-Powered Food Management & Sustainability Platform 
 
Context 
This document contains the pre-hack (Part 1) requirements for the hackathon 
project. Part 2 (onsite challenges and AI requirements) will be revealed on the 
hackathon day. 
Theme & Problem 
Many individuals and communities face challenges with food waste, inefficient 
consumption, and limited access to nutritious meals on a budget. Your solution 
should support SDG 2: Zero Hunger, by improving food security and nutrition, and 
SDG 12: Responsible Consumption and Production, by reducing waste and 
promoting sustainable practices through mindful food tracking and planning. 
High-Level Concept 
Build a full-stack web application where users (individuals, families, or 
community groups) can create profiles, log food usage, manage inventories, and 
access basic tools for tracking consumption. In Part 1, focus on a solid 
foundation: authentication, profiles, data models, image upload for future 
scanning, and simple (non-AI) logging and reporting. 
General Technical Guidelines 
You can pick any technology or tech stacks. 
o  Full-stack web app using any modern stack. 
o  Persistent database for users, food logs, inventories, and resources. 
o  Clean, responsive, and usable UI. 
o  Deployed or easily runnable locally with clear instructions. 
PART 1 – REQUIRED FEATURES (TO BE COMPLETED BEFORE ONSITE) 
1. Authentication & User Management 
o  Implement user registration and login (email/password or similar 
secure method). 
o  Basic validation (e.g., required fields, invalid email format, 
password length). 
o  Store at minimum: 
▪  Full name 
▪  Email 
▪  Household size or dietary preferences (e.g., vegetarian, 
budget range) 
▪  Location (for future local features) 
2. User Profile & Consumption Logging 
o  Create a Profile page for each user. 
o  Users must be able to: 
▪  Add or edit basic details like budget preferences and dietary 
needs. 
▪  Log daily food usage manually (e.g., item name, quantity, 
category like vegetable/dairy). 
▪  Manage a simple inventory list (add/remove items with 
quantities and dates). 
o  Additionally: 
▪  Provide a simple way to note or store consumption history 
(no AI/processing required in Part 1; just store this data). 
3. Food Items & Inventory Database (Seeded Data) 
o  Create and seed a food items/inventory collection or table. 
o  Each item entry should include at least: 
▪  Item name 
▪  Category (e.g., fruit, dairy, grain)
